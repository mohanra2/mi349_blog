        <p>Hi, thank you for visiting this page! My name is Sakthi Mohanraji. I am a junior at Michigan State University studying Information Science with hopes of going into cybersecurity in the future. As an Indian girl and woman in STEM, I have always tended to stick out in many situations. And like many of my loved ones and peers, I have had my fair share of struggles with my mental health.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies are:</p>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Spending time with friends and family</li>
        <li>Singing</li>
        <p>Growing up with a culture that has demonized mental health issues in the past, and living in a society where people are looked down on for voicing their feelings, it is only expected that many individuals suffer in silence with their health problems, sometimes not even feeling comfortable sharing their thoughts with those closest to them. 
           I created Honest Hope with hopes of creating a platform to raise awareness for mental health disorders, cultivate discussion and understanding, and breaking barriers to combat mental health stigma. Ending mental health stigma is a battle that will need to be fought for many years to come, but even a single step is still progress.
